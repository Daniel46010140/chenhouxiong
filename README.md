AI for education.
We use program to imitate the thinking of human(students) when solving questions.
OCR,ASR,TTS,MT,NLP,and NN will be considered.
The programming language is maily Python.
When machine is able to answer question, we can train it to learn to solve more.
Finally, it may help us think and do research.
